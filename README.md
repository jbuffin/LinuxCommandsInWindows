LinuxCommandsInWindows
======================

Some helpful cmd files that will translate linux commands to their Windows counterpart.

These files should be placed somewhere like "C:\linux_commands\"
Then add that same location to your PATH. Open a cmd window and enjoy some linux commands.

TODO:
  - add argument support to commands that need it
  - add more commands

NOTE ABOUT CYGWIN:
Some of these commands will not work if you have Cygwin installed. Cygwin will take precedence over these.
